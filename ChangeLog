intervalxt Change Log
=====================

.. current developments

v3.3.5
====================

**Changed:**

* Changed the recommended setup for developers to use pixi instead of conda/mamba.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed compatibility with fmt library version 11.
* Fixed usage of LDADD and LDFLAGS in automake setup.



v3.3.4
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fixed access to `left()` and `right()` of a component from Python.



v3.3.3
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fixed typos in documentation.
* Fixed building libintervalxt with fmt version 10.



v3.3.2
====================

**Added:**

* Added automatic testing on macOS in our CI setup.
* Added support for Python 3.10 to the automated tests.

**Removed:**

* Removed explicit support for Python 3.6 since it reached its end of life in 12/2021; i.e., we are not testing with Python 3.6 in our CI anymore.
* Removed the static library from the conda package that we upload with every commit to the master branch to the flatsurf channel. To our knowledge nobody is using these builds. They can sometimes be useful for debugging because they are built with debug symbols (which is why they are very big.) Providing a static library that nobody should use anyway is eating up the limited storage on anaconda.org twice as fast so we disable this.

**Fixed:**

* Adapted CI setup on GitHub to changes in setup-miniconda.
* Adapted to breaking changes in exact-real 3. (The library should work with both exact-real 2 and 3.)
* Removed unused includes from source code.



v3.3.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* Use only fully supported packages from conda-forge in CI (and not the experimental builds from the flatsurf channel with incompatible dependencies.)
* Allow build with fmt library version 6, 7, 8 or 9.
* Fixed compile error on clang/macOS.



v3.3.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added `IntervalExchangeTransformation::boshernitzanNoSaddleConnection()` to certify the absence of saddle connections in an IET.

* Added `IntervalExchangeTransformation::boshernitzanEquations()` and `IntervalExchangeTransformation::boshernitzanSaddleConnectionValues()` to expose equations underlying `IntervalExchangeTransformation::boshernitzanNoPeriodicTrajectories()` and `IntervalExchangeTransformation::boshernitzanNoSaddleConnection()`.
* Added fallback printing of `interalxt::Label` to an `std::ostream` when `Lengths::render` is not available.

* Added fallback printing of a `Label` in Python when the corresponding `Lengths` are not available.

**Removed:**

* Removed unused `length.ipp` header.

**Fixed:**

* Made all methods of `intervalxt::Length` and `intervalxt::Length` accessible from Python.

* Removed libtool scripts from repository.

* Removed broken binder tests from CI. (We should instead build a conda package and run tests with that package installed.)
* Compilation with clang on macOS



v3.2.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added `LIBINTERVALXT_API` markers to support building with `-fvisibility=hidden -fvisibility-inlines-hidden`.
* Added support for version script when linking on Linux, i.e., producing a library that only exports a minimal set of symbols. Enable with ./configure --with-version-script.

**Fixed:**

* Allow build with fmt library version 6, 7 or 8.



v3.1.4
====================

**Fixed:**

* Remove debug output.



v3.1.3
====================

**Fixed:**

* Adapted to changes in latest e-antic RC



v3.1.2
====================

**Fixed:**

* Cylinders and components without periodic trajectories next to undetermined components are now properly detected and not reported as undetermined as well.



v3.1.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* serialization of IETs with e-antic and exactreal lengths



v3.1.0
====================

**Added:**

* Assertions and parameter checks can be disabled at runtime by setting the environment variables `LIBINTERVALXT_NOASSERT` and `LIBINTERVALXT_NOCHECK`.

**Fixed:**

* Do not print timing information when running Boshernitzan criterion and actually use the fast default algorithm. (Debug output that should not have been committed.)



v3.0.4
====================

**Fixed:**

* Require `cppyythonizations` for `pyintervalxt` conda package.
* updated .gitignore files

**Performance:**

* speed up the Boshernitzan criterion by using a Mixed Integer Program internally instead of Polyhedra functionality in PPL.



v3.0.3
====================

**Added:**

* run CI and deploy with Python 3.8 and Python 3.9.

**Changed:**

* use GitHub Actions for CI

**Fixed:**

* Test with assertions enabled and also publish to anaconda with assertions enabled.
* Do not run GitHub Actions on forks but only on Pull Requests. If you really want this, you could push to your fork's master branch.
* simplified build instructions with conda/mamba in README
* Rever script now bumps the version number of the conda package correctly.



v3.0.2
====================

**Performance:**

* use specialized `renf_elem_fdiv` for floor divisions with e-antic elements



v3.0.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* commit links in ASV reports
* Report coverage changes on Pull Requests
* Do not build conda package against broken fmt-7.1.0



v3.0.0
====================

**Changed:**

* A `DynamicalDecomposition` can now be copied (sharing a reference to the same underlying data.)

* Simplified `noexcept` qualifications on all methods in the public API.

**Removed:**

* Public `HalfEdge` constructor. Half edges should always be created by extracting them from a component's contour.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed two memory leaks in decomposition due to circular sequences of shared
  pointers. And refactored the internal data structures quite heavily.



v2.1.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* `Component::iet()` returned a `unique_ptr`; there's no need for that since
  `IntervalExchangeTransformation` can be moved (and easily copied if needed.)
  So we now return an IntervalExchangeTransformation instead. (technically, a
  breaking API & ABI change but nobody is using this functionality that we
  released a few minutes ago yet.)



v2.1.0
====================

**Added:**

* Component::iet() to be able to debug problems in Lengths implementations by
  working on a stripped down copy of the Interval Exchange Transformation
  underlying a component



v2.0.2
====================

**Fixed:**

* hang in `Component::decompositionStep`, should fix https://github.com/flatsurf/flatsurf/issues/136



v2.0.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* `sample::Coefficients` for exact real types; also added (trivial) tests for coefficients

* libintervalxt is not linked against e-antic and exact-real anymore. Instead, the tests are only run when these libraries are present.



v2.0.0
====================

**Added:**

* IntervalExchangeTransformation::equivalent() method to decide whether two
  interval exchange transformations are equivalent modulo the precise labeling.
* The `Lengths` of an `IntervalExchangeTransformation` are not available as
  `iet.lengths` in Python. This is probably limited to interval exchange
  transformations originally created through the Python interface.

**Changed:**

* Split `::intervalxt::sample::Arithmetic` into
  `::intervalxt::sample::FloorDivision` and
  `::intervalxt::sample::Coefficients`. The latter now accepts a vector of
  elements and produces a vector of Q-vectors that correspond to the given
  elements after being brought into the same vector space. This is a breaking
  API change.

* The method `Lengths::coefficients()` now expects a vector of labels and
  produces a vector of Q-vectors corresponding to realizations of the
  corresponding lengths in a common Q vector space.

* The method `IntervalExchangeTransformation::safInvariant()` now returns a
  `vector<mpq_class>` instead of a `valarray<mpq_class>`. The valarray had
  always been a source of issues since it does not play nicely with vectors
  that we use everywhere else in the flatsurf stack.
* In the Python interface, `IET` has been renamed to
  `IntervalExchangeTransformation` and `makeLengths` to `Lengths`.

* `sample::Lengths` over integer types now require `gmpxxll` to be available.

**Fixed:**

* Most labels now print nicely in the Python interface.
* negative lengths are now detected in the Python interface and reported as an error, #85



v1.0.3
====================

**Added:**

* safety checks for rever deploy script

**Changed:**

* upgraded clang-format to clang version 10



v1.0.2
====================

**Changed:**

* release with rever
