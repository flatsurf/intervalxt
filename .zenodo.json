    "description": "<p>intervalxt is a C++/Python library which implements algorithms on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_exchange_transformation'>Interval Exchange Transformations (IETs)</a>.</p> <p>In particular, we implement the <em>Boshernitzan Algorithm</em> and <em>Rauzy Induction</em> on IETs. Our principal application is the decomposition of a measured foliation into periodic and minimal components. We certify that a component is minimal with the Boshernitzan Algorithm or by certifying that the Rauzy Induction will be looping infinitely. Note that presently the algorithm is probably incomplete; in rare cases no further decomposition of a component seems to be possible, nevertheless, our criteria fail to certify minimality of the component.</p><p>Please visit our <a href='https://github.com/flatsurf/intervalxt'>homepage</a> for more information.</p>"
